# Cookielab Code Club Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Cookielab Code Club challenges](https://code-club-website.patrik-dvoracek.workers.dev/). Each challenge lives in its own directory with language-specific implementations and inputs.

## Structure
- `patrik-insane-cryptographic-authentication/`: Solutions in `elixir/` and `swift/` plus problem input and test data.
- `roman-numerals/`: Solutions in `elixir/` and `erlang/` with the challenge input.
- `vibe-base/`: Solutions in `cpp/` and `elixir/` with accompanying input and test data.

Each challenge directory includes its own README (if present) and language folder(s) with source code. Inputs for the puzzles are in `input.txt` files; some challenges also include `test-data/` fixtures.

## How to use
1. Pick a challenge directory and read its README for specifics.
2. Choose a language implementation inside that directory (for example, `elixir/`, `swift/`, `cpp/`, or `erlang/`).
3. Follow any language-specific instructions in that folder to build/run the solution against `input.txt` or the provided test data.

## Notes
- The repository is organized by challenge; there is no shared build or dependency configuration at the root.
- Solutions were written per challenge, so tooling and setup may differ between language folders.
